## What is Kusk?

KUSK is a cryptocurrency created for low energy consumption, fast transactions, and decentralisation. For more details, see the [White Paper](https://kusk.top/info/KUSK-WhitePaper.html) for more details.

In the current state `kusk` is able to:

- Manage key, account as well as asset
- Send transactions


## Building from source

### Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.8 or higher, with `$GOPATH` set to your preferred directory

### Installation

Ensure Go with the supported version is installed properly:

```bash
$ wget -c https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local

$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

$ source ~/.profile

$ go version
```

- Get the source code

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/KUSK-TOP/kuskcore.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/kuskcore
```

- Build source code

``` bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kuskcore
$ make kuskd    # go build kuskd
$ make kuskcli  # go build kuskcli
```

When successfully building the project, the `kuskd` and `kuskcli` binary should be present in `cmd/kuskd` and `cmd/kuskcli` directory, respectively.

### Executables

The Kusk project comes with several executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command      | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **kuskd**   | kuskd command can help to initialize and launch kusk domain by custom parameters. `kuskd --help` for command line options. |
| **kuskcli** | Our main Kusk CLI client. It is the entry point into the Kusk network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node archive node (retaining all historical state). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Kusk network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `kuskcli --help` |

## Running kusk

Currently, kusk is still in active development and a ton of work needs to be done, but we also provide the following content for these eager to do something with `kusk`. This section won't cover all the commands of `kuskd` and `kuskcli` at length, for more information, please the help of every command, e.g., `kuskcli help`.

### Initialize

First of all, initialize the node:

```bash
$ cd ./cmd/kuskd
$ ./kuskd init --chain_id mainnet
```

There are three options for the flag `--chain_id`:

- `mainnet`: connect to the mainnet.
- `testnet`: connect to the testnet wisdom.
- `solonet`: standalone mode.

After that, you'll see `config.toml` generated, then launch the node.

### launch

``` bash
$ nohup ./kuskd node &
```

available flags for `kuskd node`:

```

Given the `kuskd` node is running, the general workflow is as follows:

- create key, then you can create account.
- send transaction, i.e., build, sign and submit transaction.
- query all kinds of information, let's say, avaliable key, account, key, balances, transactions, etc.
